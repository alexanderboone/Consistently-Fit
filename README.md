# Consistently Fit

ConsistentlyFit is a full-stack website built using Django and React.js with two goals in mind:
1. Build a public API chocked full of common fitness exercises, including associated muscle groups targeted and instructions on how to perform each exercise.
2. Create a simplified front-end for ease-of-use and less clicking/scrolling while in the gym (I'm talking to you, guy who hogs the only bench press while staring at your phone)
